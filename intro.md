# I'm Brianna but you can call me Breezy

I have completed an Honours Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity at Deakin University, graduating with first class honours and a WAM of 96. My academic performance has been recognised through awards including the Deakin Scholarship for Excellence and the Associate Dean Summer Research Scholarship.

My Honours research focused on developing a mathematical framework for optical x-haul network design to support reconfigurable 6G networks using O-RAN architectures. Building on this foundation, I am now enrolled in a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at Deakin University. My doctoral research extends this work into disaster recovery and disaster-resilient network design, with a particular focus on natural hazards and their impact on telecommunications infrastructure. The research emphasises mathematical modelling, optimisation, and network resilience to support robust and adaptive communication networks under disruptive events.

## My Academic Journey

Throughout my studies, I have achieved several academic highlights, including features in the Deakin Maths Yearbook for my HD reports in Cryptography (SIT192), Quantum Cryptography (SIT281), and Optimisation and Constraint Programming (SIT316). My research focuses on telecommunications networks, particularly the planning and optimisation of optical x-haul networks to support reconfigurable O-RAN architectures for 6G networks. This work builds on my research conducted under the Associate Deakin Research Summer Scholarship, where I initially explored computer networks and developed a strong interest in Radio Access Networks (RAN).

I presented this research at the Optical Fiber Communications Conference (OFC), with the extended version of this work subsequently published in the Journal of Optical Communications and Networking (JOCN). I also currently have a survey paper on telecommunication network planning and dimensioning methodologies under review.

## Projects

During my time at university, I've developed a passion for teaching and sharing knowledge. I’ve created guides on topics such as computer networks, cryptography, and quantum cryptography, designed to help students understand complex concepts through tutorials, examples, and Python implementations.

To explore my guides in detail, visit my [Projects Page](content/projects.md).

## My skill Set

Through my university subjects and side projects I’ve developed skills in numerous programming languages. In addition, I’ve developed skills in tools and software that help boost my skill set. Recently, I switched from Windows to Linux to take advantage of its open-source nature and enhanced security.

## About Me

I originally ventured into Cybersecurity during the rise of Global cyber threats in late 2022. What started out as curiosity quickly turned into me enrolling into my degree!

I quickly became interested in Cryptography after studying Discrete Mathematics where I received the grade of 95, I wasn’t a maths person prior to doing that subject, but the unit chair and content changed that for me. During my Cryptography subject I got to explore the world of Quantum Computing. I originally chose this topic for my HD tasks only because it seemed really cool! Boy did I have it in for myself though, I spent significant time having to learn physics and quantum physics to pull it off. But the hard work paid off, with the report being selected to be published in the [Deakin Maths Yearbook](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-3336557334/view). Making me the first person to be featured twice, let alone in the same year.

Over the 2023/2024 summer, I was fortunate to receive the Associate Deakin Research Summer Scholarship, where I began research into computer networks. Given the freedom to explore, I delved into areas of interest with my supervisor’s encouragement, ultimately discovering a passion for Radio Access Networks (RAN). This led me to focus on O-RAN and resource allocation for 6G networks.

Now, as an Honours student in telecommunications and computational mathematics, I’m developing a mathematical framework for optical xhaul network design, aimed at supporting cost-effective deployment strategies for future reconfigurable RAN and xhaul networks. Growing up in rural Australia, I understand firsthand the challenges of limited phone service, which fuels my dedication to this research.

## Work Experience

I have held multiple roles at Deakin University, ranging from academic support to curriculum development and now working within teaching as an Associate Teaching Fellow. My responsibilities include marking, conducting help hub sessions, and developing learning materials for computer networks and SAP. I have also contributed to the SMS Evaluation Team, facilitating evaluations and improvements for the student mentoring program.

## Capstone Subjects

My Capstone projects have provided valuable opportunities to develop both technical and leadership skills. In Capstone A, I led the SplashKit tutorials team for [Thoth Tech](https://github.com/thoth-tech), and my efforts were rewarded with a perfect grade of 100. Capstone B focused on technical contributions to SplashKit core and the Splashkit website with usage examples and a beyond Splashkit project which also received a perfect grade of 100.
