# Why did I pick cybersecurity?

Hey there! I'm currently navigating through my second year as a cybersecurity student at Deakin University. Yep, you heard it right. The world of hackers, malware, and all those techy buzzwords you've probably heard a million times. But here's the kicker: just a few short years ago, the mere thought of me using a Windows PC without a bewildered expression was laughable. So, what led me, a self-proclaimed tech newbie, down the rabbit hole into the world of cybersecurity?

## The Flashback:

Looking back over the last decade or so, I often find myself pondering, "How on earth did I end up here?" In high school, my relationship with computers was... let's just say, non-existent. IT classes? A hard pass. Yet, for reasons beyond my current comprehension, I chose to study French because it seemed “easy”. (Seriously, what was I thinking?) Fast forward to my 17-year-old self, fresh out of high school, and clueless about my career path. It's tough figuring out your life's calling when you're barely acquainted with the world around you.

## The Unexpected Turn:

My high school days and early adulthood were spent working at Woolworths, where I was the mastermind behind those deliciously fresh cream cakes and everyone's favourite apple turnovers. Little did I know, this job had nothing to do with my budding interest in computers.

Then came 2022, a year I've since coined "The Year of Data Breaches." Witnessing the Optus and Medibank data breaches unfold was nothing short of an eye-opener. Watching friends struggle with an onslaught of spam messages post-leak sparked a curiosity in me. How could such breaches happen? Why is our data so vulnerable?

## The Eureka Moment:

I've always had a knack for spotting patterns—connecting dots over breakfast cereal is my kind of jam. My curiosity peaked when I saw a news segment about these breaches. Despite the sea of incomprehensible numbers on the screen which were definitely just for show, something clicked. "How cool is this?" I thought. The only catch? My self-proclaimed ineptitude at math, thanks to my high school days (but that's a story for another blog post).

Driven by curiosity, I dove headfirst into researching data breaches. Questions like "Why isn't our data more secure?" and "How do hackers easily snatch our information?" consumed me. This obsession, possibly fueled by my ADHD, led me to explore degrees in cybersecurity.

## The Journey Begins:

Fast forward to March 2023, and there I was, embarking on my cybersecurity degree. Was it everything I expected? Not exactly. But has it been a journey of discovery, learning, and unexpected interests? Absolutely. While my career may not ultimately lie in cybersecurity (stay tuned for more on that in a future post), I couldn't be happier to have started this adventure.

## The Takeaway:

If you've made it this far, here's my nugget of wisdom: When you stumble upon something that ignites your curiosity—no matter how unexpected—chase it. The path may not lead where you initially thought, but the journey? It's guaranteed to take you to places beyond your wildest dreams.
