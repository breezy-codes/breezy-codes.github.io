During my time at university, I’ve developed a passion for teaching and sharing knowledge. To support fellow students and anyone interested in learning, I’ve created guides on various topics such as computer networks, cryptography, and quantum cryptography. These guides are designed to make complex concepts accessible through tutorials, examples, and Python implementations.

## Guides

### [Computer Networks](https://breezy-codes.github.io/computer-networks-guide)
