# Research

My research lies at the intersection of **telecommunications** and **applied mathematics**, with a focus on optimising network infrastructure for future wireless communication systems. Below is an overview of my Honours research, current PhD direction, and ongoing academic contributions.

## Motivation

Growing up in rural Australia, I experienced firsthand the challenges of limited network access and unreliable connectivity. These experiences motivated my interest in developing **efficient, resilient, and accessible network solutions** to address connectivity gaps in underserved regions. This motivation has since extended into my PhD research, shaped in part by living through the **2019–2020 Black Summer bushfires**, during which many coastal communities lost telecommunications services for extended periods.

As a result, my work is driven by the goal of enabling **cost-effective, high-quality communication networks** that remain **robust under both everyday operating conditions and disruptive natural events**, with a particular emphasis on mathematically grounded models for **network resilience, recovery, and adaptation**.

## Honours Research

I completed my **Honours Bachelor’s degree at Deakin University** in telecommunications and applied mathematics. My Honours research focused on developing a **mathematical framework for optical x-haul network design**, supporting **cost-effective and scalable deployment strategies** for **reconfigurable Radio Access Networks (RAN)** and **O-RAN architectures** in beyond 5G (B5G) networks.

The project balanced performance, scalability, and affordability through rigorous mathematical modelling and optimisation. Core components of this research included:

- **Network Planning and Optimisation**: Designing efficient optical x-haul layouts to improve performance, coverage, and deployment cost.
- **Resource Allocation**: Developing strategies for dynamic allocation of resources within RAN architectures.
- **Mathematical Modelling and Simulation**: Using applied mathematics to evaluate scalability, flexibility, and trade-offs across different x-haul configurations.

This work led to a paper presented at the **Optical Fiber Communications Conference (OFC)**, followed by an extended journal version published in the *Journal of Optical Communications and Networking (JOCN)*.

## PhD Research Direction

I am currently enrolled in a **Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)** at Deakin University. My doctoral research builds on my Honours work and shifts focus toward **disaster recovery and disaster-resilient telecommunications networks**, with particular emphasis on **natural hazards** such as bushfires, floods, and extreme weather events.

My PhD research investigates **mathematically grounded resilience frameworks** for network design, including optimisation, reconfiguration, and recovery strategies that enable networks to adapt under disruption. This work draws heavily on **operations research, optimisation theory, and applied modelling**, with applications to next-generation RAN and x-haul infrastructures.

## Ongoing Research and Contributions

My research activities extend beyond formal coursework and include the following:

- **Associate Deakin Research Summer Scholarships (2023/2024, 2024/2025, 2025/2026):**  
  - *2023/2024 & 2024/2025:* Focused on computer networks before transitioning to **Radio Access Networks (RAN)**, **O-RAN**, and **6G resource allocation**, establishing a strong foundation in network planning and optimisation.  
  - *2025/2026:* Concentrated on **advanced optimisation theory**, specifically **splitting methods and Bregman divergence–based approaches** for the **Weber problem in infinite-dimensional spaces**, with emphasis on convergence properties and algorithmic efficiency.

- **Academic Publications:**  
  - Conference paper presented at **OFC**, with an extended version **published in *JOCN***.  
  - Author of a **survey paper on reconfigurable RAN** submitted to IEEE, covering network planning, resource allocation, and beyond 5G challenges.  
  - **Three additional papers currently under peer review**, spanning telecommunications network optimisation and operations research–oriented modelling.
