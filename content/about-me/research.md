# Research

My research is on telecommunications and computational mathematics, with a specific focus on optimising network infrastructure for the future of wireless communication. Below is an overview of my Honours research, plans for a PhD, and ongoing contributions to academic research in this field.

## Motivation

Growing up in rural Australia, I have experienced firsthand the challenges of limited network access and unreliable connectivity. This personal connection motivates my work in developing efficient and accessible network solutions that can address the connectivity gaps in underserved regions. My research is driven by the goal of making high-quality network access achievable in all environments, particularly rural and remote areas, through optimised, cost-effective network models.

## Honours Research

Currently, I am pursuing an Honours Bachelor's degree at Deakin University with my honours in telecommunications and computational mathematics. My Honours research focuses on building a mathematical framework for **optical xhaul network design** to support cost-effective, scalable deployment strategies for **reconfigurable Radio Access Networks (RAN)** and O-RAN in B5G networks.

This project aims to balance performance, scalability, and affordability by leveraging mathematical and computational models. The core components of my research include:

- **Network Planning and Optimisation**: Developing efficient layouts and configurations for optical xhaul networks that enhance network performance and accessibility.
- **Resource Allocation**: Creating strategies to dynamically allocate resources within RAN to ensure optimal network performance under various conditions.
- **Mathematical Modelling and Simulation**: Employing computational mathematics to simulate network scenarios, enabling the evaluation of scalability and flexibility in different xhaul configurations.

I recently had a paper accepted to the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC) 2025, where I presented a mathematical model for optical xhaul network design. This model was developed prior to my Honours research and has since been expanded and refined to support my current work. I'm also working on a paper currently for the Journal of Optical Communications and Networking (JOCN) on the extension of the model from OFC. As well as a paper targeted to the field of operations research on the problem.

## Future PhD Plans

After completing my Honours research, I plan to pursue a PhD starting in late 2025, with a continued emphasis on **reconfigurable RAN** and **beyond 5G networks**. My PhD research will expand on my Honours work, with more of a focus on dynamic reconfiguration and adaptive network design to meet the evolving demands of future wireless communication technologies. Exploring the use of different functional splits and designs to achieve optimal network performance and scalability will be a key aspect of my PhD research.

## Ongoing Research and Contributions

My interest in research extends beyond my formal studies, encompassing several research-related activities:

- **Associate Deakin Research Summer Scholarship**: During the 2023/2024 summer, I was awarded this scholarship, where I initially focused on **computer networks**. I soon shifted my research towards **Radio Access Networks (RAN)**, developing a strong interest in **O-RAN** and **6G resource allocation**. This experience provided a solid foundation in network planning and optimisation, which continues to guide my Honours and PhD research. I was also awarded this scholarship again for the 2024/2025 summer, where I continued my research into RAN and xhaul networks.

- **Academic Publications**: In addition to my recent conference acceptance at OFC 2025, I've submitted a survey paper on **reconfigurable RAN** for IEEE, which discusses network planning, resource allocation, and the challenges of implementing beyond 5G networks. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this area and highlight the potential for future advancements. I've also submitted a paper extending my OFC research, which is currently under peer review. This paper focuses on the mathematical modelling aspects of optical xhaul network design and its implications for future network architectures.
