# Academic Accomplishments

My academic journey has been marked by a strong commitment to excellence, reflected in my high WAM of 95.75. I have received several awards, including the Deakin Scholarship for Excellence and the Associate Dean Summer Research Scholarship. My research interests lie in telecommunications and computational mathematics, with a focus on optical x-haul network design to support reconfigurable O-RAN in 6G networks.

## Highlights

- **Discrete Mathematics and Cryptography:** Achieved a score of 95 in Discrete Mathematics, which ignited a passion for Cryptography. This interest led me to explore Quantum Computing and tackle the complex topic of Quantum Cryptography. My report on this topic was selected for the *Deakin Maths Yearbook*, making me the first person to be featured twice in the same year. I will also be featured in the 2024 maths yearbook for my work on optical xhaul networks.

- **Research Summer Scholarship (2023/2024 and 2024/2025):** I was awarded the Associate Deakin Research Summer Scholarship, during which I initially researched computer networks. I then discovered my interest in Radio Access Networks (RAN), specifically in the areas of O-RAN and 6G resource allocation. Growing up in rural Australia, where reliable phone service is a challenge, has further motivated my research in this field.

- **Current Honours Research:** Currently undertaking an Honours degree in telecommunications and computational mathematics, where I am developing a mathematical framework for optical xhaul network design. This research builds on my summer work and aligns with my long-term goals in telecommunications.

- **Conference Papers:** First-authored a paper accepted to the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC) 2025, where I presented a mathematical model for optical xhaul network design.

- **Research Publications:** I've submitted a paper currently under peer review as an extension of my OFC research, as well as a survey paper on reconfigurable RAN for IEEE. These papers discuss network planning, resource allocation, and the challenges of implementing beyond 5G networks. I am also actively working on a new paper focused on the operations research aspects of these problems.

- **Leadership in Capstone Projects:** Served as the team leader in the Capstone A subject, where I led the tutorials team for SplashKit within the Thoth Tech company. My contributions were recognised with a perfect grade of 100 in both Capstone A and Capstone B.

- **Tutorial Series Creator:** Developed a comprehensive tutorial series that assists students in understanding complex computer network concepts. This effort contributed to my achieving a perfect score in the subject.

- **Future Plans:** After completing my Honours degree, I plan to pursue a PhD in telecommunications and computational mathematics.
