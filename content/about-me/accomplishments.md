# Academic Accomplishments

## Highlights

- **Discrete Mathematics and Cryptography:** Achieved a score of 95 in Discrete Mathematics, which ignited a passion for Cryptography. This interest led me to explore Quantum Computing and tackle the complex topic of Quantum Cryptography. My report on this topic was selected for the *Deakin Maths Yearbook*, making me the first person to be featured twice in the same year.

- **Research Summer Scholarship (2023/2024):** I was awarded the Associate Deakin Research Summer Scholarship, during which I initially researched computer networks. I then discovered my interest in Radio Access Networks (RAN), specifically in the areas of O-RAN and 6G resource allocation. Growing up in rural Australia, where reliable phone service is a challenge, has further motivated my research in this field.

- **Current Honours Research:** Currently undertaking an Honours degree in telecommunications and computational mathematics, where I am developing a mathematical framework for optical xhaul network design. This research builds on my summer work and aligns with my long-term goals in telecommunications.

- **Conference Papers:** Submitted my first research paper on this topic to a conference, with three more papers in progress. Each paper is aimed at advancing knowledge in 5G/6G and RAN technology.

- **Leadership in Capstone Projects:** Served as the team leader in the Capstone A subject, where I led the tutorials team for SplashKit within the Thoth Tech company. My contributions were recognised with a perfect grade of 100.

- **Tutorial Series Creator:** Developed a comprehensive tutorial series that assists students in understanding complex computer network concepts. This effort contributed to my achieving a perfect score in the subject.

- **Future Plans:** After completing my Honours degree, I plan to pursue a PhD in telecommunications and computational mathematics.
