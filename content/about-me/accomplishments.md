# Academic Accomplishments

My academic journey has been marked by a strong commitment to excellence, reflected in a final WAM of 96. I have received several awards, including the Deakin Scholarship for Excellence and the Associate Dean Summer Research Scholarship. My research interests lie at the intersection of telecommunications and applied mathematics, with a focus on optical x-haul network design and optimisation to support reconfigurable O-RAN architectures for 6G networks. I am now pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), extending this work into disaster recovery and disaster-resilient network modelling, with particular emphasis on natural hazards and mathematically grounded resilience frameworks.

## Highlights

- **Discrete Mathematics and Cryptography:** Achieved a score of 95 in Discrete Mathematics, which ignited a passion for Cryptography. This interest led me to explore Quantum Computing and tackle the complex topic of Quantum Cryptography. My report on this topic was selected for the *Deakin Maths Yearbook*, making me the first person to be featured twice in the same year. I will also be featured in the 2024 maths yearbook for my work on optical xhaul networks.

- **Research Summer Scholarship (2023/2024 and 2024/2025):** I was awarded the Associate Deakin Research Summer Scholarship, during which I initially researched computer networks. I then discovered my interest in Radio Access Networks (RAN), specifically in the areas of O-RAN and 6G resource allocation. Growing up in rural Australia, where reliable phone service is a challenge, has further motivated my research in this field.

- **Research Summer Scholarship (2025/2026)**: I was awarded the Associate Deakin Research Summer Scholarship for a third consecutive year. This project focuses on advanced optimisation methods, specifically the development and analysis of splitting methods and Bregman divergence–based approaches for the Weber problem in infinite-dimensional spaces. The work emphasises mathematical foundations, convergence properties, and algorithmic efficiency, with relevance to large-scale optimisation problems arising in network design and related applications.

- **Honours Research (Completed):** Completed an Honours degree in telecommunications and applied mathematics, achieving an honours grade of 100, developing a mathematical framework for optical xhaul network design. This work built on my summer research and underpins my ongoing PhD work in disaster-resilient network modelling and optimisation.

- **Conference Papers:** First-authored a paper accepted to the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC) 2025, where I presented a mathematical model for optical xhaul network design.

- **Research Publications:** The extension of my OFC 2025 paper has been accepted and published in the Journal of Optical Communications and Networking (JOCN). I have also submitted a survey paper on reconfigurable RAN which is currently under review, covering network planning, resource allocation, and deployment challenges for beyond‑5G systems. In addition, I have 2 more papers under peer review.

- **Leadership in Capstone Projects:** Served as the team leader in the Capstone A subject, where I led the tutorials team for SplashKit within the Thoth Tech company. My contributions were recognised with a perfect grade of 100 in both Capstone A and Capstone B.

- **Tutorial Series Creator:** Developed a comprehensive tutorial series that assists students in understanding complex computer network concepts. This effort contributed to my achieving a perfect score in the subject.

- **Future Plans:** Having just completed my Honours degree, I am now starting a PhD in telecommunications and applied mathematics to continue my work on optical xhaul network design, disaster‑resilient network modelling, and disaster recovery strategies.
