# My Publications

My research has led to several publications, including conference papers and journal articles. Below is a list of my notable publications:

1. [An Introduction To Cryptography](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=exg3AzgAAAAJ&authuser=1&citation_for_view=exg3AzgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) - This is my first publication, which was featured in the Deakin Maths Yearbook. It provides an overview of cryptographic principles and their applications.
2. [An exploration into quantum mechanics and how it's changing cryptography](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=exg3AzgAAAAJ&authuser=1&citation_for_view=exg3AzgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) - This publication, also in the Deakin Maths Yearbook, delves into the intersection of quantum mechanics and cryptography, exploring how advancements in quantum computing are reshaping cryptographic methods.
3. [Optical X-haul for Beyond 5G: Cost-effective Deployment Strategies](https://doi.org/10.1364/OFC.2025.M1I.3) - This paper, accepted at the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC) 2025, presents a mathematical model for optical x-haul network design. It focuses on cost-effective deployment strategies for reconfigurable Radio Access Networks (RAN) in Beyond 5G networks.
4. [Cost Optimal Network Planning for Converged Optical X-haul in Beyond 5G Networks](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.567406) - This journal article, published in a special issue of the Journal of Optical Communications and Networking (JOCN), expanding on the work presented in the OFC 2025 paper. It provides a comprehensive analysis of cost-optimal network planning for converged optical x-haul in Beyond 5G networks.
5. [A cost effective framework fo the design and deployment of B5G in rural Australia](https://dro.deakin.edu.au/articles/book/Mathematics_Yearbook_2024/29670008?file=57115337) - Published in the Deakin Mathematics Yearbook 2024, this paper discusses a framework for designing and deploying Beyond 5G networks in rural Australia, addressing the unique challenges faced in these areas.
