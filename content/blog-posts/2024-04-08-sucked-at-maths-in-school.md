# I sucked at maths in highschool

Imagine thinking you're not cut out for academic success because high school was a battleground where victory seemed impossible. Now, fast forward a few years, and picture yourself receiving accolades for your mathematical success in university. Sounds like a dream? Well, it became my reality. From barely scraping by in high school to having my mathematical reports published in the Deakin Maths Yearbook – twice in a single year – my journey is a demonstration of the fact that past struggles don't define your future potential. This isn't just my story; it's a beacon of hope for anyone who's ever felt defeated by their academic journey. If you've ever doubted your capabilities or felt overwhelmed by educational hurdles, this story is especially for you.

## Oh High school…

Yep, as the title hints, I was far from a math wizard in high school. To be honest, I wasn't exactly acing any of my subjects. But here's the kicker – it really doesn't matter. Not in the grand scheme of things. My high school years were a blend of minimal effort and maximum daydreaming, partly due to un-diagnosed ADHD—a challenge I only faced head-on in adulthood. I was that student who passed, yes, but just barely, doing the absolute minimum to get by.

## A Turnaround in Disguise

University was where the plot twisted. My first semester introduced me to discrete mathematics – a subject whispered about in hushed tones of dread. A high distinction felt as likely as being struck by lightning. Yet, by the semester's end, I notched a grade of 95. This achievement wasn't just luck; it was the result of an environment I flourished in, I found my thing finally and it gave me relentless perseverance to keep trying and learning as much as I could. My work in discrete maths and cryptography didn't just score high – they were selected for publication in the Deakin Maths Yearbook, marking me as the first-ever student featured twice, let alone in the same year.

## Thanks ADHD?

The significant turnaround in my academic performance partially stemmed from an ADHD diagnosis received in adulthood. Initially, this diagnosis felt like a blow, reinforcing stereotypes I had internalized about ADHD. Yet, it eventually became a lens through which I could understand my past struggles and navigate my future with greater clarity and strategy. I finally knew why I did things the way I did, and how I could embrace those to my advantage.

## Making a Difference

My journey took an unexpected yet fulfilling turn when I became a student mentor at the Country University Centre Southern Shoalhaven, working with Year 8 students. There, I worked with Year 8 students, helping them discover their strengths and values. It was a chance for me to get over my own shame I’ve had from my high school years. I kept it bottled up for a long time, before realising my story could be a beacon for others who might be struggling, showing them that their current challenges don't dictate their future successes.

## My new interest in Quantum Cryptography

Interestingly, my work on quantum cryptography played a significant role in building my love for mathematics, leading me to explore calculus and physics. The complexity and elegance of these subjects, their application in cutting-edge technology, and their fundamental role in our understanding of the universe have captivated me. I’ve watched way too many series about physics and the universe (Black holes are so cool). Now I’m armed with a 1,400-page calculus textbook, and starting on a journey through the language of the universe with a heck of a lot of maths to do.

## So! Embrace the Journey

If there's anything my journey has taught me, it's that past academic struggles are not a life sentence. They're merely stepping stones to greater successes. Whether you're battling ADHD, facing academic hurdles, or simply doubting your capabilities, remember this: with the right strategies, support, and mindset, transformation is not just possible; it's inevitable. Your story isn't over; it's just waiting for its next chapter to be written. Share your journey, seek support when needed, and never stop exploring your passions.
